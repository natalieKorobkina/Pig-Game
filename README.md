Pig Game

Pig Game is one of a family of dice games described as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains.  

Install

The game doesn't require any additional installation. You can start to play by clicking on file “index.html”. Also, you can drag-and-drop it to your browser.

Rules

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
3. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
4. The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
